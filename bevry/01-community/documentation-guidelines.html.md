Pull requests must conform to the following criteria:

- ### GitHub Flavoured Markdown
	We use [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) for all our documents.

- ### Single paragraph pull requests only
	Each pull request should only alter one paragraph.  This makes the process of merging the change simple.

- ### International/British English for Text, USA/American English for Code
	We love it when people fix spelling errors and typos! We use International/British English for text (only 27% of our visitors are from the USA), and USA/American English for code. Code examples should (where it makes sense to) comply with the [Bevry Coding Standards](http://bevry.me/bevry/coding-standards). If you do not know what the differences are, no worries, still submit your pull request and we'll merge it in and fix it up after if needed.

- ### Explain changes
	Please provide brief notes on the benefit of the change.

- ### No external documentation supplements yet
	We are not yet ready to add resources to community documentation and videos yet. We need to figure out the best way to present the data while avoiding common pitfalls like out of sync or conflicting documentation.

- ### Use the "Files Changed" tab to comment on pull requests
	When commenting on pull request changes, instead of commenting on individual commits, use the pull request's "Files Changed" tab. This allows your comments to persist as the pull request developers, rather than be forgotten when the next commit comes in.
