## Welcome to [Bevry's](http://bevry.me) [Documentation](http://bevry.me/learn/) Repository

It's pulled into the [Bevry](http://bevry.me) website and rendered by [DocPad](http://docpad.org) into beautiful documentation. Feel free to submit pull requests and post issues for it — one of our moderators will get to your changes as quickly as possible :)


## Note on Links

Links inside the documentation may look like `/project/page` which within GitHub will go to an incorrect URL. This is because these links are short links that are expanded by DocPad during generation process. You can trial this by cloning out the [Bevry Website](https://github.com/bevry/website) yourself :)
