	Community Support is provided by people facing the same issues whom team up to help each other during their spare time. Unlike Paid Premium Support, there are no guarantees.

So you must state the project that you’re using in your question.* Some of our projects already have tags that you can use too.

For instance, if you send in an email and that spawns a new development task we may reference you to the github issue behind it so you can track and participate in its progress.
